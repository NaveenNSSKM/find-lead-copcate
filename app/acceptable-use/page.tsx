        </h3>

         <p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">5.1 Subscriptions.</span>
         Findlead offers various options and subscriptions plans to its clients, including free trials and paid plans. These options and plans, including relevant pricing, are available at https://Findlead.ai/pricing. The pricing of these plans are in U.S. dollars and all payments will be made in U.S. dollars.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-5">(a) Free trials: Free trials are non-paid access of the Findlead Service subject to use restrictions (maximum limits to the number of daily and monthly emails and support ticket requests, restriction on API calls, restriction on number of Credits, etc.). Restrictions for such trials are set forth at https://Findlead.ai/pricing. Subscriber may at any time terminate Subscriber’s free trial or upgrade to a paid plan.</p>


<p className="mb-5">(b) Paid plans (“Email warm-up”, “Email outreach”,“B2B Contact Data Tool”, & "Supersearch"): These paid plans have lower use restriction limits than the self-service free subscriptions. Premium features may also be added to these plans. Subscriber’s paid subscription shall be due and payable either on a monthly or yearly basis in advance from the date of Subscriber’s first paid subscription and will be automatically renewed thereafter on the same basis, subject to the full payment in advance of the fees due. Subscriber may not re-subscribe to the same paid monthly plan within twenty-one (21) days for the same account. Subscriber may at any time terminate Subscriber’s paid self-service plan and Subscriber will have the right to continue to access and use the Findlead Service through the end of the subscription plan for which Subscriber has paid. However, Findlead shall not refund or reimburse  Subscriber for any unused Fees paid for a started month or year, even on a pro rata basis nor will Findlead provide a discount for future Services under such circumstances. It is Subscriber’s responsibility to anticipate the termination of the plan to make it effective at the most convenient time. </p>

<p className="mb-5">(c) Automatic Renewal. Under a paid plan, the subscription will continue and automatically renew at Findlead's then-current price for such Subscription until terminated in accordance with this Agreement. The frequency at which the subscription renews (i.e., monthly, annually, etc.) will be designated at the time at Subscriber signs up for the subscription. By subscribing, Subscriber authorizes Findlead to charge the payment method designated in their account now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of the subscription, if Findlead does not receive payment, (i) Subscriber shall pay all amounts due on their account upon demand and/or (ii) Subscriber agrees that Findlead may either terminate or suspend the subscription and continue to attempt to charge the designated payment method until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, the subscription will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, Subscriber’s new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).</p>

 <p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">5.2 Fees.</span>
         Subscriber will pay Findlead the fees for the Findlead Service (or Credits as defined below) upon checkout, and thereafter, at such intervals in accordance with Subscriber’s selected plan at checkout (“Fees”).  Fees for plans listed above do not include the cost of equipment and Internet access enabling use of the Findlead Service, the costs of which shall be borne by Subscriber. All Fees are due in advance of each Subscription Term. Payment may be made by credit card or direct debit. Subscriber authorizes Findlead to charge the credit card or bank account Subscriber provides to Findlead for any and all costs and amounts that Subscriber owes Findlead for the Findlead Service, at the time such amounts are due. Subscriber shall maintain complete, accurate and up-to-date Subscriber billing and contact information.

Findlead may increase the applicable Fees upon the commencement of any Renewal Order Term (as defined below).

Please note that online payment transactions may be subject to validation checks by Findlead’s Third-Party Service Provider and Subscriber’s card issuer, and Findlead is not responsible if Subscriber’s card issuer declines to authorize payment for any reason. For Subscriber’s protection, Findlead’s Third-Party Service Provider uses various fraud prevention protocols and industry standard verification systems to reduce fraud and Subscriber authorizes Third-Party Service Provider to verify and authenticate Subscriber’s payment information. Subscriber’s card issuer may charge Subscriber an online handling fee or processing fee. Findlead is not responsible for this. In some jurisdictions, our Third-Party Service Provider may use third parties under strict confidentiality and data protection requirements for the purposes of payment processing services.

Findlead reserves the right (in addition to any other rights or remedies Findlead may have), upon written notice, to discontinue the Findlead Service and immediately suspend Subscriber’s access to the Findlead Service if any Fees are more than thirty (30) days overdue until such amounts are paid in full.

(a) Credits. In certain instances, Subscriber may be able to receive credits (such as a benefit as part of a membership or subscription to the Findlead Service) or otherwise purchase credits (the “Credits”) to access and use certain features of the Findlead Service. If Subscriber purchases Credits, Subscriber will be charged the corresponding Fees.

Credits may only be used during any timeframe specified at the time of purchase, or if no timeframe is specified, such Credits will expire at the end of the applicable subscription period; provided, however, if such subscription period is renewed, then Credits may be rolled over twice to the immediately subsequent subscription period. Thereafter, if such Credits are not used, Subscriber will lose access to any such unused Credits. Subscriber agrees and understands that in the event that Subscriber terminates this Agreement or a subscription plan or otherwise ceases using the Findlead Service, Subscriber will lose access to any unused Credits. Credits have no cash value, cannot be reloaded, resold, transferred for value, traded or sold on secondary markets, redeemed for cash, or applied to any other account or subscription, except to the extent required by law. Findlead reserves the right to change terms and conditions of Credits without notice. The volume or amount of Findlead Service (or any other functionality) that Credits can be used to obtain is not based on a fixed dollar amount and is subject to change at the sole discretion of Findlead at any time.         </p>

<p className="mb-6">‍(b)Promotional Credits. From time to time, Findlead may make available at its sole discretion Credits for loyalty, award or promotional purposes, including as part of free trials (“Promotional Credits”). Promotional Credits may expire in accordance with any terms set forth on such Credits. No purchase is necessary to be eligible to receive Promotional Credits. Promotional Credits are eligible for redemption for features of the Findlead Service in the same manner as any paid for Credits, but the redemption value of such Promotional Credits may be different from paid Credits.

 <p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">8.1 Term.</span>
         The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and continue until terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the “Term”).  Each subscription will have an initial term of one (1) year or one (1) month, as dictated by the plan that Subscriber purchases (the “Initial Order Term”), and will automatically renew for successive terms of the same period as the Initial Order Term (each, a “Renewal Order Term” and collectively with the Initial Order Term, the “Order Term”), unless either party provides no less than thirty (30) days written notice of its intent to terminate the Order prior to the end of the then-current term.  The term of each subscription will be as set forth in the applicable subscription plan and will automatically renew for successive terms of the same duration, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the subscription plan.
</p>


 <p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">8.2 Termination.</span>
Either party may terminate this Agreement or specific subscription plan upon written notice if the other party materially breaches the Agreement or the terms of the subscription plan and does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach. Further, either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party is declared insolvent, admits its inability to pay its debts when due, or files for, or otherwise undergoes, bankruptcy.  Findlead may also immediately terminate this Agreement or suspend Subscriber’s access to the Findlead Service without notice pursuant to Section 4.8 (Account Termination and Circumvention), which shall be deemed a non-curable material breach of this Agreement. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement or specific subscription plan for any reason any amounts owed to Findlead under this Agreement will become immediately due and payable.  Sections 1, 4.4 and 6-13 will survive the termination of this Agreement.
</p>

 <p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">8.3 Effect of Termination.</span>
         Upon termination or cancellation of the Agreement or any applicable subscription plan: (a) By Subscriber: Upon termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any applicable subscription plan by Subscriber, Subscriber’s access to the Findlead Service will cease, and Findlead may, in its sole discretion, delete any Subscriber Data or other data associated with the terminated account in accordance with Findlead’s then-current data retention policies. However, Findlead shall not be obligated to delete any Subscriber Data unless required by applicable law. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Findlead is under no obligation to retain, recover, or make available any such data following termination, but may, in its sole discretion, do so for a limited time. (b) By Findlead: In its sole discretion, Findlead may, but is not required to, provide Subscriber with a limited opportunity to access and download Subscriber Data prior to permanent deletion. If such an opportunity is provided, Findlead shall specify the duration of the access window in writing. After the expiration of such period, Findlead shall have no further obligation to retain or recover any Subscriber Data.

<p><strong>12. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION (THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY. IT IS PART OF SUBSCRIBER’S CONTRACT WITH Findlead AND REQUIRES SUBSCRIBER TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITH Findlead AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH SUBSCRIBER CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM Findlead. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. </strong></p>


 <p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</span>
         Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, Subscriber and Findlead agree that any dispute, claim, or disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to Subscriber’s access to or use of the Findlead Service, any communications Subscriber receives in connection with the Findlead Service, any products sold or distributed through the Findlead Service, or this Agreement and any prior versions of this Agreement to which Subscriber agreed , including claims and disputes that arose between Subscriber and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration as set forth below, rather than in court, except that: (i) Subscriber and Findlead may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) Subscriber or Findlead may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
</p>


 <p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.2 Informal Dispute Resolution.</span>
         Should a Dispute arise between Subscriber and Findlead, Findlead is committed to working with Subscriber to reach a reasonable resolution. Subscriber and Findlead agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. Subscriber and Findlead therefore agree that, before either party commences arbitration against the other to resolve a Dispute (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), that party will try to resolve the Dispute informally by participating in a telephone or videoconference, (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If Subscriber is represented by counsel, Subscriber’s counsel may participate in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, but Subscriber will also participate in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Findlead that Subscriber intends to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to legal@Findlead.ai or regular mail to our offices located at 30 North Gould Street, Suite R, Sheridan, WY 82801.</p>

<p className="mb-6">The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree otherwise; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.</p>


<p className="mb-6">In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.</p>


<p className="mb-6">The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p>


<p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.3 Waiver of Jury Trial.</span>
         YOU AND Findlead HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. Subscriber and Findlead are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 12.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. 
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.4 Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</span>
YOU AND Findlead AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 12.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 12.9 (Batch Arbitration). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, determines that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), Subscriber and Findlead agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of Wyoming. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This section does not prevent Subscriber or Findlead from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p>

<p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.5 Rules and Forum.</span>
         This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of Subscriber’s Notice, Subscriber and Findlead agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at <Link  className="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800" href='https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf'>Click Here.</Link></p>



<p className="mb-6">Unless Subscriber and Findlead otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 12.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where Subscriber resides. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Subscriber’s responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules. </p>




<p className="mb-6">Subscriber and Findlead agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p>





<p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.6 Arbitrator.</span>
         The arbitrator will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of receiving written notice of the arbitration from the AAA, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 12.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.7 Authority of Arbitrator.</span>
         The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 12.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 12.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 12.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 12.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 12.9 (Batch Arbitration). The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon Subscriber and Findlead. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.8 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.</span>
         The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If Subscriber or Findlead need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.
</p>


<p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.9 Batch Arbitration.</span>
         To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, Subscriber and Findlead agree that in the event that there are fifty (50) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Findlead by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).

All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”).
</p>

<p className="mb-6">In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Findlead.Subscriber and Findlead agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p>


<p className="mb-6">This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p>






<p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.10 30-Day Right to Opt Out.</span>
         Subscriber has the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of Subscriber’s decision to opt out to: 30 North Gould Street, Suite R, Sheridan, WY 82801, within thirty (30) days after agreeing to or becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Subscriber’s notice must include Subscriber’s name and address, the email address associated with Subscriber’s Account (if Subscriber has one), and an unequivocal statement that Subscriber wants to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If Subscriber opts out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to Subscriber. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that Subscriber may currently have, or may enter in the future, with Findlead.
</p>


<p className="mb-6">
         <span className="font-bold italic">12.11 Invalidity, Expiration.</span>
         Except as provided in Section 12.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any Section or part of any Section of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific Section or part(s) of Section shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Subscriber and Findlead further agree that any Dispute as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, Subscriber and Findlead agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>


<p className="mb-6">
