Our products include our website and all of the services we offer through that website (the the “Products” or “Services”). When you use our Products, you provide personal information to us. We wrote this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we use it and disclose it, how long we retain it, and what choices you have about it.

            Some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. You may have specific privacy rights in your state or region. In the United States, residents of California and other states have specific privacy rights as noted in the disclosures below. Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and the United Kingdom also have specific rights, which are noted in other disclosures below.

        </p>

        <p className="mb-10">
            This Privacy Policy applies where findlead acts as a “data controller” which means findlead decides why and how personal information is processed. It does not apply to situations where findlead acts as a “data processor” which means it processes data only according to contractual instructions from its customers or other data controllers. findlead works with a variety of third party data providers and connects them to findlead customers who are looking for information about businesses and individuals who work at these businesses. In doing so, findlead acts as a data processor because it is acting according to the instruction of its customers per its data processing agreements with those customers. findlead does not control the data supplied by the third party data providers it works with and, as a data processor, is not in a position to delete data or otherwise discharge the responsibilities of a data controller.

Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
        </p>


<p className="mb-6">We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
